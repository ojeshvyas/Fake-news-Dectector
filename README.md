# Fake-news-Dectector
It shows the probability of the news if its fake or not

To Run this:

1: run .py file in external console (command prompt)

2: copy the address which is shown while you run the file (it is creating the local server)

3: paste the link in browser and paste the news you want to check 

It is that easy..!!

Limitations:
It is trained on the database created b/w (2015-17) so latest news will not be verified.

If you want to verify for current news you can train another model on recent database which is available on Kaggle and paste the path of saved trained model in the code (.py file)
